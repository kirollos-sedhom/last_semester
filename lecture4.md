1- Software Testing Life Cycle
 a- requirement analysis
 b- test planning
 c- test case development
 d- test environment setup
 e- test execution
 f- test closure

2- software testing estimation
 - metrics based
 - expert based
2.1- Pert
2.2- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
2.3- Wideband Delphi
2.4- percentage distribution

3- software test metrics
 - schedule slippage
 - number of test run per time period
 - fixed defects percentage
 - percentage test cases executed
 - requirements creep

4- Entry criteria: when to start testing

5- Exit criteria: when to stop testing

6- test progress monitoring and control

7- test reporting

8- test work products
 - created in test process
 - examples: test planning work products (test plan)
             test monitoring work products (test reports)
             test analysis work products (test conditions)
             test design work products (test cases)
             test implementation work products (test procedures and test suites)
             test execution work products (defect reports)
             test completion work products (summary reports)

9- test reporting audience
 - determines the type and amount of information included in the report

10- test control
 - guiding and corrective actions as result to reports

11- test strategy vs test plan

12- test scenario
 - like a high level test case

13- test case
 - prepared after test scenarios
 - might be logical or physical test case
 - might be negative or positive test case

14- defect report
 - states the problem as clearly as possible

15- test procedures
 - the sequence of actions for a test

16- test execution schedule

17- requiurement traceability matrix RTM

18- test closure report
