1- Error (mistake) leads to defect leads to failure

2- testing objectives
 - evaluate work products
 - make sure requirements are fulfilled
 - find and prevent defects

3- seven testing principles

4- psychology of testing
 - identifying defects is not criticism to the author
 - confirmation bias
 - be constructive
 - need great interpersonal skills
  
5- key performance indecator (KPI)

6- testing through the SDLC
 - waterfall: test after completion
 - incremental: test each piece
 - iterative: test after each cycle

7- static testing
 - relies on manual examination
 - can be formal or informal

7.1- inspection
 - most formal
 - includes manager, moderator, author, reviewers, and scribe

7.2- review techniques
 - ad hoc
 - checklist based
 - scenarios and dry runs

7.3- success factors for reviews
 - measurable exit criteria

8- testing methodologies
 - black box: uses user stories
 - white box: may be performed at all test levels

9- types of software testing
 - functional testing
 - non funcitonal testing
 - white-box / structural testing
 - change related testing (confirmation and regression testing) performed at all test levels

9.1- unit testing
 - carried out by developers

9.2- integration testing
 - component integration testing 
 - system integration testing (interaction between systems and packages)
 - driver calls component. component calls stub

9.3- system testing
 - validates fully integrated software product

9.4- acceptance testing
 - user acceptance testing: important because users have different perspective that developers
 - operational acceptance testing: by operations/administration staff
 - alpha and beta testing

10- load vs stress vs volume

11- debugging
 - its a development step, not testing step 
 - in agile, testers might do debugging

12- maintenance testing
 - happens after deployment to production environment
 - planned releases
 - unplanned releases (hotfixes)
